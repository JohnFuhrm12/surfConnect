# surfConnect

SurfConnect allows surfers to connect with surf photographers to create a marketplace for surf photos.

I developed a REST API to interact with the connected MongoDB database with Node.js and powered the visuals with a React.js front-end. 

Tech Stack used:
React.js | Node.js | Express | Mongoose | React-Router | Typescript | Javascript | Cloudinary
